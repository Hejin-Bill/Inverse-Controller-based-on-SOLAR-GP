# Inverse Defromable Controller based on SOLAR-GP

Original version of SOLAR-GP please refer to https://github.com/ucsdarclab/SOLAR-GP

## Getting Started

* Run SOLAR_API.py to see a toy example of online estimating a sine wave use SOLAR-GP
* Run move2center() in tissue_grasp_2d.py to see a demo of grasping 2D tissue. Nx and Ny represent the number of particles on x (horizontal) and y (vertical) direction correspondingly. 

## Running the tests

* Run the main of tissue_grasp_2d.py to see the 2D inverse controller of grasping. (Currently some bugs un-fixed)
 
## Acknowledgments

* The original version of SOLAR-GP is developed by Brian Wilcox and Michael C. Yip
